\* ULIDOrdering TLC Configuration
\*
\* Run with:
\*   java -jar tla2tools.jar -config ULIDOrdering.cfg ULIDOrdering.tla
\*
\* Expected: TLC finds a counterexample for LastCommitterWins when
\* clock_skew is enabled. The trace shows w2 committing after w1 but
\* receiving a lower ULID due to clock skew, causing the query to
\* return w1's value instead of w2's.

SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Primary invariant — EXPECTED TO FAIL with clock_skew = TRUE.
\* To test with normal clocks, change Init to set clock_skew = FALSE
\* and this invariant should HOLD.
INVARIANT LastCommitterWins

\* Type safety — expected to hold:
\* INVARIANT TypeOK
