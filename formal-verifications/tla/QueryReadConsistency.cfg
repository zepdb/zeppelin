\* QueryReadConsistency TLC Configuration
\*
\* Run with:
\*   java -jar tla2tools.jar -config QueryReadConsistency.cfg QueryReadConsistency.tla
\*
\* Expected: TLC finds a counterexample for QueryNeverHitsOrphan.
\* The trace shows a query reading a stale manifest snapshot, then
\* compaction deleting the referenced fragments before the query reads them.

SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Primary invariant — EXPECTED TO FAIL.
INVARIANT QueryNeverHitsOrphan

\* Alternative invariant — also expected to fail.
\* Uncomment to check when fragments disappear relative to query state:
\* INVARIANT QueryFragmentsExistWhenNeeded

\* Type safety — expected to hold:
\* INVARIANT TypeOK
