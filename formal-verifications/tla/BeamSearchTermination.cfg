\* BeamSearchTermination TLC Configuration
\*
\* Run with:
\*   java -jar tla2tools.jar -config BeamSearchTermination.cfg BeamSearchTermination.tla
\*
\* Expected: All invariants hold (no counterexamples).
\* Verifies beam search terminates and reaches leaves for both
\* balanced and unbalanced (mixed-depth) tree structures.

SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Deadlock is expected: search terminates at pc = "done".
CHECK_DEADLOCK FALSE

\* Search completes within MaxSteps (never hits safety bound).
INVARIANT SearchTerminates

\* No node is expanded twice.
INVARIANT NoRevisiting

\* Beam level monotonically decreases (progress toward leaves).
INVARIANT LevelMonotonicity

\* At least one leaf cluster is found.
INVARIANT LeafReachability

\* Type checking.
INVARIANT TypeOK
